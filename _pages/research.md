  Foreign aid is a political exchange between a donor and target. Existing literature focuses
  primarily on donors, but less is known about how targets advance their interests. I model the aid
  exchange using a costly signaling model in which targets send a (potentially misleading) signal
  of their policy preferences before the donor makes an aid offer. In equilibrium, when the cost of
  a misleading signal is sufficiently low, targets who are aligned with a donor on policy lie about
  their alignment at least some of the time, which yields them aid that they would not have received
  otherwise. After mapping the model into empirical implications, I show that nonresponse in the
  UN General Assembly – a low-cost signal of nonalignment – is correlated with higher future aid
  inflows. This argument highlights the role of aid-receiving states as strategic actors who can
  extract concessions from donors.

  The U.S. and China are entering a new era of major-power competition in which foreign aid serves as a tool for contesting global influence.      What is the effect of competition on the distribution of aid from China and the U.S. across the globe? While the literature has studied how      specific factors (e.g., democracy) affect the amount of foreign aid a country receives, we still do not know whether these factors affect the    preferences of the U.S. and China for giving aid directly or indirectly via competition and strategic interaction. In this paper, we answer      these questions by adopting a structural approach: we construct a game-theoretic contest model of aid distribution and estimate its parameters   given the observed foreign aid commitments of the two countries. The structural approach allows us to (1) estimate the degree to which aid       given by one major power to a specific recipient country responds to the expectations of its rival’s aid to the same country; (2) see whether    other factors of potential recipient countries (e.g., democracy) moderate the U.S and China's response to each others' aid; and (3) compare a    country's observed distribution of aid to the counterfactual distribution that would arise absent competition from its rival.
