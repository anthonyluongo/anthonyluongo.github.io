I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) at Emory University. I am interested in international political economy, particularly the allocation and impacts of foreign aid. I use formal models and causal inference methods with observational data to explore these topics. In my dissertation, I will explore the ways that recipients of foreign aid extract concessions from donors and the conditions under which those strategies are most successful. I have written for [*Democracy in Africa*](http://democracyinafrica.org). 

I hold a B.A. in International Relations and Economics from Michigan State University, where I was a member of [James Madison College](http://jmc.msu.edu) and a Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellow in Swahili with the [MSU African Studies Center](https://africa.isp.msu.edu/). I have also completed coursework in Swahili and Tanzanian culture and politics at [MS Training Centre for Development Cooperation](http://mstcdc.or.tz) in Arusha, Tanzania.
