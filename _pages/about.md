I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Emory University. My research interests are in the politics of foreign aid, particularly the politics of donor competition and the impact this competition has on governance in recipient countries. I have a regional interest in Sub-Saharan Africa.  

I hold a B.A. in International Relations and Economics from Michigan State University, where I was a member of James Madison College and Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellow in Swahili. I have also completed coursework in Swahili and Tanzanian culture and politics at MS Training Centre for Development Cooperation in Arusha, Tanzania.
