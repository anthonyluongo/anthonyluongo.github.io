I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) at Emory University. My research is in international political economy, particularly the allocation and impact of foreign aid. In my dissertation, I focus on the strategies that small states employ to pursue their interests in their interactions with great powers and international organizations. Other projects explore US-China competition and how aid affects environmental protection efforts in recipient countries. 

Before coming to Emory, I earned a B.A. in International Relations and Economics from Michigan State University, where I was a member of [James Madison College](http://jmc.msu.edu) and a Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellow in Swahili with the [MSU African Studies Center](https://africa.isp.msu.edu/). I have written for [*Democracy in Africa*](http://democracyinafrica.org).
