I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/) at Emory University. My research interests are in the politics of foreign aid, particularly the politics of donor competition and the impact this competition has on governance in recipient countries. I have a regional interest in Sub-Saharan Africa. I have written for [*Democracy in Africa*](http://democracyinafrica.org). 

I hold a B.A. in International Relations and Economics from Michigan State University, where I was a member of [James Madison College](http://jmc.msu.edu) and a Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellow in Swahili. I have also completed coursework in Swahili and Tanzanian culture and politics at [MS Training Centre for Development Cooperation](http://mstcdc.or.tz) in Arusha, Tanzania.
