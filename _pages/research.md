"Playing Hard to Get: Strategic Signaling in Aid Bargaining"
  <details>
|   <summary>Show abstract</summary>

|  Foreign aid is a political exchange between a donor and target. Existing literature focuses
|  primarily on donors, but less is known about how targets advance their interests. I model the aid
|  exchange using a costly signaling model in which targets send a (potentially misleading) signal
|  of their policy preferences before the donor makes an aid offer. In equilibrium, when the cost of
|  a misleading signal is sufficiently low, targets who are aligned with a donor on policy lie about
|  their alignment at least some of the time, which yields them aid that they would not have received
|  otherwise. After mapping the model into empirical implications, I show that nonresponse in the
|  UN General Assembly – a low-cost signal of nonalignment – is correlated with higher future aid
|  inflows. This argument highlights the role of aid-receiving states as strategic actors who can
|  extract concessions from donors.
